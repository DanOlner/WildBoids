## Human (1)

In this folder, in the build/_deps folder, there are several files so large that they wouldn't be able to sync to github, including a .git folder. What are those and can I gitignore them while keeping the core project code still syncing to github?


## Assistant

```bash *(List build/_deps contents)*
ls /Users/danolner/Code/claude/wildboids/build/_deps/
```


## Assistant

```bash *(Check current gitignore)*
cat /Users/danolner/Code/claude/wildboids/.gitignore 2>/dev/null; echo "---EXIT:$?---"
```

> **Tool result:** catch2-build catch2-src catch2-subbuild json-build json-src json-subbuild

> **Tool result:** ---EXIT:1---


## Assistant

The `build/` directory contains CMake FetchContent downloads (Catch2 and nlohmann/json) — these are fetched automatically during the build and should never be committed. You don't have a `.gitignore` yet, so the entire `build/` folder (plus a couple other things) should be ignored.


## Assistant

*[Write: `/Users/danolner/Code/claude/wildboids/.gitignore`]*

> **Tool result:** File created successfully at: /Users/danolner/Code/claude/wildboids/.gitignore


## Assistant

Created [.gitignore](.gitignore) with:

- **`build/`** — This is the entire CMake build directory. Everything in it (including `_deps/catch2-*`, `_deps/json-*`, compiled objects, etc.) is regenerated by `cmake -B build -G Ninja` and `cmake --build build`. It should never be in version control.
- **`.cache/`** — Build tool cache (also in your untracked files).
- **`.DS_Store`** — macOS metadata files.

All your source code in `src/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc. will still sync to GitHub. Anyone cloning the repo just runs the CMake configure + build commands to regenerate everything in `build/`.

If you already have `build/` or `.DS_Store` tracked by git, you may need to remove them from tracking:

```
git rm -r --cached build/ .DS_Store
```

Does .vscode settings json need to be on github for any reason?


## Assistant

Generally no — `.vscode/` contains your local editor settings (workspace preferences, launch configs, extension recommendations). Unless you're collaborating and want to share those settings, it's personal config.


## Assistant

*[Edit: `/Users/danolner/Code/claude/wildboids/.gitignore`]*

> **Tool result:** The file /Users/danolner/Code/claude/wildboids/.gitignore has been updated successfully.


## Assistant

Added `.vscode/` to the gitignore.
