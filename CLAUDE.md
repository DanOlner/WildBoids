Back in 2007 I wrote some Java code to simulate 'wiild boids' - two types of boid, predator and prey, that began with randomised sensory rules (similar in form to the traditional Reynold's boids but designed to be 'genetically' described). Successful predators would be cross-bred, succesful prey would be cross-bred (i.e. the ones that survived). I want to update this. Ideally this would be hosted in the browser, so running on Javascript or similar. But it may be it's too computationally intensive for that - TBC.
